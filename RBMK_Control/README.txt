Hello, thanks for installing my program!
As you probably know, this is a RBMK controller program that uses the OpenComputers Compatibility to control, monitor, and manage RBMKs.

Make sure to read the license, and for any concerns or questions contact me at microwave#6732 on discord or create an issue on GitHub.

** ONLY CLOSE PROGRAM WITH CTRL-C, DO NOT FORCE INTERRUPT. **

Anyway, now to the program itself. This program consists of 5 parts.
1. Fuel info.
2. Control rod control.
3. Boiler functions.
4. Automatic run.
5. Redstone functionality.

How to connect components to the computer:
    Step 1: Make a computer, (for large reactors, a server rack and server will be needed).
    Step 2: Connect to power, either from an external energy source, or from an HE to RF converter.
    Step 3: Connect computer/server rack to RBMK component, (This can be done by connecting the cable
to ANY component of the reactor (bottom), and it will connect to all components).
    Step 4: Attach a Redstone I/O port or a redstone card in computer/server.
    Step 4: Run program, and make sure that all components are visible on screen.
    Step 5: Go to next step.

How to use the program:
    Step 1: Complete the previous step, then continue.
    Step 2: If you are using boiler columns, or a mix of ReaSim and RBMK boiler columns, then enter 'Y' for the boiler prompt.
    Step 3: Continue with the prompts.
    Step 4: The menu should pop up, It's quite slow, so give it a few seconds.
    Step 5: You're done!
